# ljsim
Ivan Sutherland's simulation program for link-and-joint asynchronous circuits

# Overview

This code was written by Ivan Sutherland (and the others at the [ARC](https://arc.cecs.pdx.edu//)) sporadically over the past two decades to perform high-level simulation of Marly Roncken's link-and-joint model for asynchronous circuits. He gave it to me and said that I could do whatever I wished with it as long as it would be helpful to me, so I am putting it on GitHub, making an effort to understand it, and planning to port it to Common Lisp. Any help with the latter two items would be greatly appreciated.
